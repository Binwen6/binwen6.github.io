# A New Chapter

There are times when our thoughts are undermined in some subtle way.

## Worldview

Take me as an example, when it comes to a tough work that could not be done in one shot, it turns out to be much more complicated practically then, than how tough it should have been. In other words, you'll be more prone to making poor decisions, developing **path dependence**, and falling into cognitive traps. What is the reason behind it? Maybe just *a kind of inertia* with a tendency toward sensationalism inherent in human nature.  
Sometimes one would pick on others without any reason, annoying others and keep their distance from him… In fact, it is just the ego and the inability to tolerate others doing better than oneself that are at play.  
It is always the case that we have a bad **sense, estimation and control** of time. For example, you will fail to make good use of a period of time to accomplish what could have been done within it, simply because you feel it is insufficient.  
A little fairy dwells within our minds, spreading our present emotions throughout our bodies, leaving us overwhelmed by feelings and unable to handle tasks that would otherwise be a breeze.

Both the first and third points address our tendency to misjudge the difficulty of tasks.




## Methodology

To reduce the likelihood of falling into cognitive traps, a reasonable approach is to tackle tasks by "starting slow and accelerating later." While this sounds straightforward, it essentially involves consciously steering your inherently path-dependent thinking toward a better course from the outset. Put it another way, this is precisely why thorough preliminary research and thoughtful consideration can make your entire investigation twice as effective with half the effort.  
To calm the little voice that's currently clouding your mind and rescue your brain from its mental rut, one effective approach is to change your approach to the task at hand. This includes, but isn't limited to, shifting your environment, reorganizing your thoughts, or conducting further research.  
A balanced and sustainable workflow should incorporate all elements of work, relaxation, and rest. Contrary to what you might expect, maintaining roughly equal proportions—about one-third each—often proves more efficient than squeezing relaxation and rest time to the absolute minimum.  

## Conclusion

Metacognition doubles your productivity.
